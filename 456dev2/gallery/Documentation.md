## Challenge Brief (as its to be written in RIO):

I've heard reports of abuse on my new image hosting site.
Can you find the flag?

## Solve:

from the homepage:
view one of the available galleries
view the source url for any image (e.g. /upload/Domestic_cat_with_harness.jpeg)
notice it is an /upload/ directory, navigate to it directly
see directory listing, open /upload/flag.txt
