Upload the following files in Source/ as one zip file:
* casino
* casino.c
* Dockerfile
* build_docker.sh

Run the challenge by running `./build_docker.sh`.

Reflag by replacing flag.txt before re-running it.

The `casino` binary is already built, but if you need to re-compile it, run `gcc casino.c -o casino -no-pie`.
This may affect the existing solve.py, but if it does, the only difference should be the offset from the buffer to the return address.
