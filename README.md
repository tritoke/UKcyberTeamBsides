# Bsides ‘let’s build CTF challenges’ challenge

## Welcome, UK Cyber Team!
Gear up and sharpen those skills! 

We're thrilled to announce a fantastic opportunity to showcase your creativity, technical prowess, and cybersecurity expertise by developing Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges for the upcoming Bsides Bristol event later this year.

This isn't just another training exercise—this is your chance to leave a lasting mark on one of the UK's most respected cybersecurity conferences. Imagine teams from around the region battling it out, attempting to unravel your puzzles, crack your codes, and navigate through your crafted scenarios.

Your unique blend of problem-solving abilities, technical ingenuity, and cybersecurity knowledge positions you perfectly for this task. Whether you're a master at reverse engineering, an expert in web exploits, a forensic whiz, or an architect of intricate cryptographic puzzles—your creativity and skill will be front and centre.
So, let's collaborate, innovate, and deliver a set of challenges that will not only test participants' limits but also showcase the exceptional talents within our UK Cyber Team.

Let's build something amazing!

## How we do this:

This repository contains a __template__ directory, showcasing the ideal structure required to deploy and host your CTF challenges. This structured approach is like our BootUp CTF model, providing essential guidelines and manageable limitations to streamline provisioning and maintaining environments.

Challenge Submission Made Easy

1.	Branch from Main:

Using GitHub Desktop, branch from the main with your username. Add your challenge data to this new branch. (Don't worry if you accidentally commit to main; we can fix it, but let's try to avoid this!)

2.	Clone and Rename the Template:

Copy the __template__ folder and rename it with your username. Keep all your creative solutions here.

3.	Complete the Challenge Document:

Clearly define your challenge in the provided document. This is crucial, it contains the title, description, instructions, and a detailed brief for players. Include instructor debrief notes for explaining the solution or the thought process behind your challenge. Mention alternative solution paths or resources used during creation if applicable.

4.	Complete the Engineering Document:

Briefly outline technical instructions for your challenge. Whether it's a simple file hosted in S3 or detailed multi-container Docker setups, clearly specify compilation methods, included files, networking details, or special technical considerations like static memory addresses.

## Limitations & Guardrails

To maintain a seamless experience for up to 10,000 simultaneous BootUp CTF participants, we've set essential guidelines:

1.	Challenge Formats: Downloads, Docker-based services, web applications, APIs, static HTML apps, container-based server-side apps, or AWS Lambda functions.

2.	Networking: Keep it simple—avoid complex networking between containers.

3.	File Size: Maximum of 256 MB per downloadable file. Please avoid large disk images.

4.	Independent Challenges: Ensure every challenge stands alone without dependencies on other challenges.

## Why so Strict?

Reliability matters! These guidelines ensure your challenges are robust and manageable at scale. We want participants to focus on solving puzzles—not troubleshooting technical issues. Let's provide players with a stable, exciting, and memorable CTF experience.
